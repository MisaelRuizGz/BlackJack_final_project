# BlackJack_final_project

This is my final project: a simple BlackJack game implemented in Python.

## How to Run

Run the script with Python:

```bash
python blackjack.py
```

Follow the prompts to play the game. You start with 1000 chips and can bet up to 500 per round. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without busting.

## Rules

- Number cards (2–10): Face value
- J, Q, K: 10 points each
- Ace (A): 1 or 11, whichever is better
- Dealer hits until 17 or higher
- Winning pays 3:2
- Bust if over 21
